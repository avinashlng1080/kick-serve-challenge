- [ ] Fetch next_movie_page only if we don't have it in the db.  Check the pages variable  
- [ ] Use proper screen container with SafeAreaView and ScrollView to cater for all screen dimensions  
- [ ] Nice to have - show the bottomBar Favorite icon bolder if we do have favorite movies  ???
- [ ] Implement Details page
- [ ] Test on both iOS and Android devices - If possible, test on tablets also.   
- [ ] Write proper unit tests - check for empty and filled states  
- [ ] Perhaps, some API call will occur in parallel and update the movie info separately from the main flow.
- [ ] Remove unused libs, files, etc. 
- [ ] Fix all screens with SafeAreaView where necessary 
- [ ] react-native-config... read it properly (natively) on iOS and Android 
- [ ] Let James know of the env file so that the app runs smoothly
- [ ] need to find a clever way to preload image https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image#fastimagepreload-source--void
